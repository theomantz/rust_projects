    println!("The Tuple Type");

    // Compound types canm group multiple values into one type. Rust has two 
    // primitive compound types: tuples and arrays

    // Tuples are declared by writing a comma-seoparated list of values inside parenths
    // each position in the tuple has a type and the types of the different values
    // in the tuple dont have to be the same

    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("the values in the tuple are {}, {}, and {}", x, y, z);

    // In addition to destructuring we can access a tuple element directly
    // by using a period (.) followed by an index

    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;

    println!("The values of the tuple are {}, {}, and {}", five_hundred, six_point_four, one);

    // Another way to have a collection of multiple values is to have an array
    // unlike a tuple, an array must have values of the same type
    // Arrays are written as a comma-separated list within square brackets

    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Arrays are useful when you want your data to be allocated on the stack 
    // than the heap. 

    // An array is static in size while a vector can grow and shrink as needed
    // if you are unsure of which type to use, use a vector

    // An example of a good use of an array over a vector is a program that 
    // needs to know the names of the months of the year. We will likely not need
    // to add or remove months so you can safely use an array

    let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", 
                    "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];

    println!("The first array of integers a is: {:?}", a);

    println!("The months of the year are: {:#?}", months);

    // You would write an arrays type by using square brackets, and within the 
    // brackets include the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of 
    // elements in the array:

    let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("This is the type annotated array: {:?}", a);

    // i32 is unsigned 32 bit. 5 is the number of elements in the array.

    // You can also initialize an array with similar syntax. If you want to create
    // an array that contains the same value for each element, you can specify 
    // the initial value, followed by a semicolon and then the length of the array
    // in square brackets as shown here.

    let a = [3; 5];

    println!("This is the array of 5 elements, all the number 3: {:?}", a);

    // An array is a single chunk of memory allocated on the stack. You can 
    // access elements of an array using indexing, like this:

    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];

    println!("The first element of the array is {} and the second is {}", first, second);
