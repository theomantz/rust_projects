fn main() {
    // An integer is a number without a fractional component. 
    // Integer types can be between 8 - 128 bits and signed or unsigned 
    // Signed meaning that the integer can be negative
    // Ex. u32 => unsigned 32 bit integer vs. i32 => signed 32 bit integer

    // Arch or usize/isize is dependent on the computer architecture you are using
    // Ex 64-bit arch means a 64 bit integer

    // Unsigned can be between 0 and 2 ** (Â n - 1 ) - 1 while signed
    // can be between - ( 2 ** ( n - 1 ) - 1 ) and ( 2 ** ( n - 1) - 1)

    // Floating point types

    let t = true;
    let f: bool = false; // explicit type annotation
