fn main() {
    // Heres a simple comment:
    // Hello, world!

    // In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and 
    // the comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that extend 
    // beyond a single line you need to include `//` on each line

    // comments can be placed at the end of lines containing code:__rust_force_expr!
    
    let lucky_number = 7; // I'm feeling lucky today

    // You'll most often see comments on a separate line above the code its annotating

    // Rust has another type of comment, documentation comments, which are covered
    // in "Publishing a Crate to Crates.io" section of chapter 14
